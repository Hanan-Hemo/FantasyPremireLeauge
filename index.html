            <P>We are a group of family and friends who likes the EPL (English Premire Leauge) and come togther to play one of the most competitive and enjoying sport game out there.The game began with a draft picking (just like the NBA), the system choose randomly the order ,and every player can choose one player at a time.
                Every Player can choose up to 2 Goalkeepers , 5 Defenders , 5 Midlfenders and 3 Strikers.
                Every week , you can choose your squad and every week of playing called GameWeek (GW).
                The time between those Game Weeks is the time for all the members of the league to make trades with each other and request for trades from the players that are in the market, and 24 hours before the GW is suppost to begin the trade reques applied.
                The order of the apllied request is from bootom-to-top so if your position is last on the table you get to pick first.
                The points system goes like this:
                <br>
                <br>
